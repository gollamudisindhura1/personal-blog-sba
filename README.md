# Interactive Personal Blog (SBA)

A simple client-side personal blog (journal) built for the Skills-Based Assessment (SBA). It lets you create, edit, and delete posts. All posts are stored in your browser's `localStorage`, so they persist across refreshes on the same machine and browser.


## Reflection (what I learned)
- Building the UI and logic together teaches how DOM updates and application state must stay in sync.
- `localStorage` is easy for persistence in demos, but it's not secure for sensitive data or multi-user apps.
- Event delegation greatly simplifies handling actions on dynamically created elements (like posts).
- Validating inputs and giving friendly error messages creates a better UX.
